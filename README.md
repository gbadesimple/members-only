# Project 2: Members-only!

Building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

Add stylistic flourishes --extra credit.
